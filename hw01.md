1. Computer:A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming.

2. Computer science:Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers.

3. Software:Computer software, or simply software, is a generic term that refers to a collection of data or computer instructions that tell the computer how to work, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built, that actually performs the work.

4. Software engineering:Software engineering is the application of engineering to the development of software in a systematic method.

5. Alan Turing:Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS (/ˈtjʊərɪŋ/; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist.

1. Method of complements：In mathematics and computing, the method of complements is a technique used to subtract one number from another using only addition of positive numbers. 

2. Byte:The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits, representing a binary number. 

3. Integer(computer science):In computer science, an integer is a datum of integral data type, a data type that represents some range of mathematical integers.

4. Floating point:In computing, floating-point arithmetic (FP) is arithmetic using formulaic representation of real numbers as an approximation so as to support a trade-off between range and precision.
